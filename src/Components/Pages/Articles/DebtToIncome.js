            When I was first shopping for a mortgage, I remember thinking that all banks were the same and that all loans were basically the same. However, this is certainly not the case. In fact, different banks, lenders, etc., offer a variety of products (loans types) that might be specific to them. In addition to this, some banks might be pushing one kind of product over another, which can lead you to being offered a less than optimum loan product.

            The truth is, there is a variety of loan products available to suit every different kind of borrower. To begin to get your head wrapped around this, it is useful to begin to understand the kind of data that loan officers are working with when they offer you a rate and term for your purchase. In this article, I want to show you how to understand a rate sheet.

            <p className = 'paragraph-text'>
            A rate sheet is a daily sheet that a lender sends out to all of its loan officers that lists that days rates and terms across the various products that that bank offers at that time. This includes the different interest rates that are available with different amounts of money that the borrower must come up with upfrontâ€”If you come up with more money, often times you can buy down the interest rate.
